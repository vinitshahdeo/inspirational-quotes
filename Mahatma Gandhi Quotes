1. “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.” 
2. You must be the change you wish to see in the world. 
3. Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.
4. Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.
5. You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.
